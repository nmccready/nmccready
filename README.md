# Hey, I'm Nick 👋

Senior engineer with 19+ years of turning caffeine into production systems. Currently deep in AWS, Go, and TypeScript — though I've written enough JavaScript to qualify for a support group.

US patent holder. Open source maintainer. Somehow responsible for packages that get **half a million downloads per week** and I'm still not sure how that happened.

## The numbers

| Package | Weekly Downloads | What it does |
|---------|----------------:|-------------|
| [debug-fabulous](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug-fabulous) | ~526k | Lazy-eval debug logging that doesn't murder your CPU |
| [angular-simple-logger](https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular-simple-logger) | ~8k | Logger for AngularJS apps that refuse to die |
| [cfn-include](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cfn-include) | ~4.6k | CloudFormation preprocessor for the brave |
| [angular-google-maps](https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular-google-maps) | ~2.2k | Google Maps + AngularJS. Yes, still. |

## What I'm into

- **AWS** — if it's a service, I've probably broken it at least once
- **Go** — for when you want your code to compile faster than your coffee brews
- **TypeScript** — JavaScript but with a conscience
- **Open Source** — maintaining packages people depend on, whether I like it or not
- **Infrastructure** — Terraform, CloudFormation, and the quiet desperation that comes with YAML

## Current projects

- 🧱 **[brickhouse-tech](https://github.com/brickhouse-tech)** — my tools & products org. We adopt orphaned npm packages and give them working CI.
- 🤖 **[aws-sdk-go-v2-ifaces](https://github.com/nmccready/aws-sdk-go-v2-ifaces)** — auto-generated Go interfaces for every AWS SDK v2 service. Because mocking AWS shouldn't require a PhD.
- 🏒 **[lax_cread](https://github.com/nmccready/lax_cread)** — lacrosse stats site, because my kids are faster than my deploy pipeline

## Philosophy

```
if it's broken, fix it
if it's abandoned, adopt it  
if it works, ship it
if it's YAML, pray
```
